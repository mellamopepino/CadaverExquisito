# Cadaver Exquisito

"Cadáver Exquisito" or "[(Exquisite corpse)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse)" is a game/method used to write or draw
something with a group of people. By turns, each person adds something to the composition and passes it to the next person.

The idea of this project is to use that method to make a website, using React.
If someone passes this repo to you so you can collaborate, pls **read the rules**. Pull requests that don't follow these rules won't be merged.

## Rules

If you are going to make a PR to collaborate, take this rules in consideration:

- Your PR should have just **one commit**. So in the history of the repo each commit represents one single collaboration.
- You can change up to two files. No more. This means `git status` should show you just two files changed/created.
- You can also create directories for your shit. But you can not delete directories, files or move around shit that does not belong to you.
- You **can not fix or change anything of the previous code**. Again, do not mess around with someone else's shit, that's rude.
- You can instead put some new code on already existing files. You can add and reuse everything you want.
- You have to add something that is visible on the page! It does not matter what it is.

Finally:
- When your PR is merged you can pass this repo to someone else, so they collaborate! Remember that it's by turns, so it's important that you choose just **one person** as the next to collaborate. Choose wisely.
